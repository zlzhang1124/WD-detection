  Here are three additional folders: audio, decomposition, and features, where the audio folder contains the audio data after preprocessing the original audio files with audio_preprocess.py, the decomposition folder contains the IMFs data generated with signal_decomposition.py, and the features folder contains the feature data calculated with calcu_features.py. 
  Since the data used in this study include naturalistic speech samples that can be easily identified, the audio recordings will not be made public to protect the subjects' privacy. Some of the structured data after desensitization are available upon request from the corresponding author.
